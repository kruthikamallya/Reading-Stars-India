	<h6>A Community Children's Library</h6><br/>
	<p><small>On June 30, 2019, Reading Stars India inaugurated a community childrenâ€™s library at Shanthi Foundation, Jayanagar, Bangalore. About 60-70 children aged 6-14 come here to read books, listen to stories and take part in art and craft sessions.</small></p> <p><strong>Most of the children who come here have little or no reading material at home, and are the first generation in their families to attend English medium schools.</strong> </p>
	<p><small>The library is run by volunteers and is open on Sunday mornings only.</small> </p>

	<h6>Training College Student Volunteers to handle library sessions</h6><br/>
	<p><small>At BET School, we decided to involve the members of the community in the library sessions and invited volunteers from BET Sadathunissa College. Almost forty girls volunteered their time and skills, and 23 were selected from this pool. On July 29, 2019, Shahnaz Sulthana and Dr. Padma Baliga from Reading stars India trained the eager college students on how to handle a library session and make it a vibrant and enjoyable experience. The students were taught how to read aloud, use voice modulation, and importantly, how to ask questions to enable curiosity and critical thinking among children.</small> </p>
