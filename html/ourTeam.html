        <p class="write">Shahnaz, an MTech in Thermal Engineering has considerable industry and teaching experience and is currently a visiting faculty with PES University and pursuing her PhD. Shahnaz has always believed that our children lack inspiration and vision to follow their dreams, and this prompted her to start Reading Stars India, to provide underprivileged children with books from all over the world and enable them to read, learn, enjoy and pursue their dreams.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>

        <p class="write">After teaching college and high school students for over two decades, Padma decided that she needed to focus on primary education and try and make a difference. A lifelong reader, she wants every child to experience the magic of books in their life. With a doctoral thesis in gender studies and Indian children’s literature and a Library Educator Certification from Parag, Padma joined hands with Shahnaz and Tabassum to set up classroom libraries in schools and help every child to have a reading life.</p><br/><br/><br/>
