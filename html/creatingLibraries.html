    <hr/>
    <p>In January 2019, Reading Stars India was part of a dynamic team invited by the Honourable Governor of Nagaland to visit the state and evolve ways of helping the children of Nagaland.</p><br/>
    <p>We visited schools and held discussions with some of the stakeholders. As part of a pilot project, Reading Stars India helped set up libraries in four schools in and around Kohima. The Honourable Governor, Sri. P. B. Acharya himself visited the schools and handed over the books to the school authorities. </p>
