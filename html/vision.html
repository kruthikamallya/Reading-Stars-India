	<h1>Our Story</h1><br/>
	<p id="ourStory">Reading Stars India came into being when Shahnaz discovered that her maid’s children who go to an English medium school were unable to read independently. Determined to help she started reading up about the crisis in our school system, talking to stakeholders in the education sector and figuring out an effective low-cost solution for the malady that ails our schools. Shahnaz started Reading Stars India in 2018 and soon enough her passion for helping children learn to read drew Amthul Tabassum and Padma Baliga to join her organization.</p>
